  loreText: "Once revered for forging metal and inspiring awe through flame, the
    Emberguard have turned their craft into a weapon of war. Dwelling in volcanic
    forges and ash-choked wastes, they\u2019ve traded elegance for brutal efficiency.
    Their gun spells roar like dragon breath, best suited for ARs and SMGs that mirror
    their ferocity."
