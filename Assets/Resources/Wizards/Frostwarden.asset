  loreText: Descendants of the ancient cryomancers, the Frostwardens dwell in glacial
    sanctuaries charged with ancient magic. Their frozen lands shaped them into disciplined
    marksmen who wield precision sniper spells to halt foes in their tracks. Strategic
    and icy in demeanor, they dominate from a distance.
