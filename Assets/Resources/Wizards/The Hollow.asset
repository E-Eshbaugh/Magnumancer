  loreText: Wielders of forsaken magics, the Hollow were not an original Great Faction,
    instead abandoned their kin of various factions to chase unspeakable power. Hidden
    in cursed ruins and shadowed tunnels, they mastered every form of magnumancy,
    bringing upon an eternal dark curse to their whole faction. Ruthless and unpredictable,
    they walk the line between mastery and madness.
