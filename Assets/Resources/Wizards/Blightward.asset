  loreText: Magicians of medicine during the Great Goblin War, the Viridant Order
    of medical mages healed their wizard brothers on field. After being corrupted
    by corruptive spores released by goblin shamans, the powerful healers were warped
    into the Blightward, using their strong magical power and tactical knowledge
    to attack with AoE weapons to slowly poison and decay their enemies.
